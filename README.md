The final project for CAS CS 506 Computational Tools for Data Scince


Project Title: Campaign Finance Scorecard - State Reps
Team Members: Alikhan Nulanuly, Xing Yiquan,Michael Harding

## Background
In 2016, in an effort to increase transparency of political campaign finance Solomon Khan built the Explore Campaign Finance website to help citizens and journalists understand how much money was in politics and explore its influence. Unfortunately the data on the website had not been updated since 2016 and it focused on federal elections and not state elections, which is our area of  interest. Hence in this project we want to develop a campaign finance scorecard for Massachusetts State Reps to give an objective presentation of campaign finance in the state.

## Problem Statement
To develop a Campaign Finance Scorecard for elected Massachusetts State Representatives based on publicly available campaign contribution data. The Scorecard will be an objective presentation of donorsâ€™ contributions for each State Rep to answer the political research questions.
